# CODE REFACTOR CHALLENGE

This is the challenge #1 project for the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. You can view this project here: https://toryua.github.io/urban-octo-telegram/ and the repository here: https://github.com/toryua/urban-octo-telegram.git

The code was cloned from github and into the repository for toryua. Then I refactored this existing webpage to make it accessible. When you view the source code, you will find semantic HTML elements - I replaced the "<div>" elements with more descriptive words to help keep the code organized. When you view the structure of the HTML elements, you will find the elements follow a logical structure and are organized under descriptive notes.  When you view the image elements, you will find accessible alt attributes which will show when the image cannot be displayed.
